![DL-ROM](Images/DL_POF_2.gif)

## Overview

This repository contains the implementation of DL-ROM: [Deep Learning for Reduced Order Modelling and Efficient Temporal Evolution of Fluid Simulations](http://arxiv.org/abs/2107.04556).

## About DL-ROM

Reduced Order Modeling (ROM) creates low-order, computationally inexpensive representations of higher-order dynamical systems. DL-ROM (Deep Learning - Reduced Order Modelling) uses neural networks for non-linear projections to reduced-order states, predicting future time steps efficiently using 3D Autoencoder and 3D U-Net architectures without ground truth supervision or solving expensive Navier-Stokes equations. It achieves significant computational savings while maintaining accuracy.

![Framework](Images/framework_nn.png)
**Framework for the transient Reduced order Model (DL-ROM). 10 snapshots of the previously solved CFD data are stacked and used as input to the model. The model then uses a 3D encoder architecture to reduce the high-dimensional CFD data to reduced order latent vector. This latent space is then deconvolved using a 3D-decoder to produce the higher order CFD prediction at timestep t+1.**

The labels and the corresponding predictions presented are from the validation split which are not used for training. Progression of MSE with timesteps evaluated on the validation dataset. The DL-ROM model is provided with data for only the initial timestep. The simulation evolves using the predictions of the previous timesteps without supervision from the ground truth values. As expected the value of negative log MSE gradually decreases over time due to accumulation of errors. Note that decreasing lineplots of Negative Log MSE represent increasing MSE values.</b></figcaption></p>
